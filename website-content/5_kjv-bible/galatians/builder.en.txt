        ###Verse 22 {#c4v22}
        For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.

      columncontent: >
        I think Hagar was a "bond servant" and
        not a maid. Another thing I see popping
        up allot is the words "for it is
        written".

        But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.

    - 
      columncontent: |
        I'm not sure about the term "bondwoman" but it definitely shouldn't be one word. I still think this should say bond servant. The semi-colon is a giveaway that the verse has been altered. I also don't know about the word "freewoman" but that shouldn't be one word either.

        ###Verse 24 {#c4v24}
        Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
      columnwidth: uk-width-1-2@m
    - 
      columncontent: |
        The semi-colon wasn't in the KJV. Pastor Charles Garcia mentioned in one of his videos that "Agar" was New Testament for "Hagar". It makes me question the whole verse just being honest.

      columncontent: >
        Whenever I see "for it is written" I
        always have to wonder if this was there
        because it has been added so much
        throughout scriptures. Bearest?

        ###Verse 30 {#c4v30}
        Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
      columnwidth: uk-width-1-2@m
    - 
      columncontent: |
        Saith? The KJV used the word "sayeth". Bondwoman is not one word. It should probably also say bond servant instead of bondwoman. I still don't know about freewoman but that isn't a word when joined together either.
