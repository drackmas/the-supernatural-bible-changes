For He was in the Rock that saved the Israelites that day. <br>In the same way, it was only by grace and Davids faith goliath was slain. <br>For it was and always is The Heavenly Fathers Victory to proclaim.<br>In Him alone we trust. By Him alone we are kept<br>By Grace we have met and know of Him.<br>He who Loved us first.<br>Will the King of Kings find Faith on the earth?<br>Or will His Children be as they were in the dessert.<br>Will He find any that will bow and give Him glory now?<br>Though the earth is already being shaken.<br>He is the Rock of our salvation that cannot be moved.",
