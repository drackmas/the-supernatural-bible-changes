Desc: How are we supposed to pray to our Father? Do you know? Jesus told us perfectly how to pray to our Father using The Lord's Prayer. We certainly never "fell on our faces" to worship Him. This wasn't in scriptures before the bible changes but it is there now. Mandela Effect. Supernatural Bible Changes.
