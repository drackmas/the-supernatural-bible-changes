In all my ways I seek to acknowledge you.<br>Within my heart you speak words I could never know.<br>You make a heart of flesh, were there once was stone.<br>You are my home, with you I am not alone.<br>I am not only flesh and bone. <br>By the Spirit In Love and Truth you have never forsaken me<br>even in my youth.<br>When the world rejected me, you were my comfort.<br>When I was forsaken, you took me into your place of rest.<br>You did not leave me in the temptation of the wilderness.<br>You saught me even when I was in the depths of sin.<br>You saught me out, when I repented.<br>You heard my cry in the dessert.<br>You lead me into the path of righteousness for Your Name sake<br>I follow you, for you alone are Good Righteous and True.<br>By Faith I seek you,<br>Yet I still I hide my face, for how is it you have such grace?<br>The King of Peace in every storm.<br>By your shelter I am kept, in a world without comfort<br>For by which I am met with your Love and set free.<br>From captivity. <br>How can He know me and Love me still?<br>Are we not like Israel, struggling to enter in battling with flesh and sin<br>Though He is the one who molded His Children like clay.<br>His Love surpasses all understanding.<br>For He alone is Holy, and True,<br>All His children are precious in His sight.<br>For even so, unworthy to be called. <br>Without number they more than every grain of sand.<br>For He is way to the Promise Land, He will never fail.<br>Let us answer, and not hide as Jonah and the whale.<br>As His spirit is as a Dove.<br>For Truly He is the Author of Love.",
