Desc: Mandela Effect. Supernatural Bible Changes. We testify about who Jesus Christ is as The Son of God and we give our testimony of how we changed our lives after we repented for our sins and asked Him to be our Lord and Savior and that He died on the cross for our sins....but do you confess Jesus before men? Let's dig into this a bit.
