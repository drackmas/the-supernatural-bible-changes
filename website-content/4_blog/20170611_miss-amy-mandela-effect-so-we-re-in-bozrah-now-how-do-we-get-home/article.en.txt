Desc: This post covers the prophetic scriptures and biblical celestial signs that tell of our ultimate deliverance and return to earth by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  I will have a follow-up soon concerning our purpose here, and who the others are on Bozrah.

This act is usually achieved by building a strong wall around the something that needs to mature. The sheepfold is an excellent example of a Bozrah. It is/was a rock wall enclosure of loosely stacked stones, and this provided protection against \"thieves and robbers\" (John 10). The enclosure also provided protection from wolves and other animals of prey. The enclosure also contained the door of the sheepfold, an opening for the sheep to come in and go out. It was at this opening that the Shepherd would lie, in order for a thief or Wolf to come in he would have to climb over the Shepherd at the door. I have simply been calling this planet Bozrah because it is the place that we are being held until Christ comes to retrieve us and it is what the Bible calls it in scripture. The natives here can call it earth all they want, but I will never believe it is anything of the sort.",

We can not safely leave until our Shepherd comes and breaks us out of the Sheepfold. Always feel free to ask.

Who else would He want to have with Him, next to Him, judging with Him, singing with Him, following Him wherever He may go? We had Him at hello! We are the sick, downtrodden, the lonely, the sad, the abused, the addicted, the persecuted, the lost. But when we find him, when we hear his voice and see his love through his words we fall to our knees and we know Him. We are home. And we fall in love with Him. And after he cleans us up, he opens the Door to the Father and we know we are accepted and a child of God Himself. And He gives us the Holy Spirit to live within us and guide us in everything. So, we are not The Chosen because we were the Greatest, we are The Chosen because we were the meek and the least and yet when we heard and saw Him, we still loved Him with all our hearts no matter what we'd been through. We had innocent, soft hearts, not bitter or hardened. If there is something even more personal why He chose us, I do not know. This is all I have been shown.",

Then the ride was stopped here , at the wrong place, and we each got off the ride at different times as it was unloaded....just like the ferris wheel. Time is very different here also. It really doesn't exist at all. Because this is just a mirror image we're in...like you said, a simulation of sorts. Dark Majik is used to manipulate things so that we think time is passing, but Satan is also playing with it to conjure all sorts of things in the past to change the here and now. Gee, I'm tired tonight. I hope that made sense. LOL.",

        "content": "Well, I don't know how Satan was able to be so evil in the first place, I suppose we'll know someday. But I'm sure being that He was one of two of the Father's most beloved creations I'm sure the Lord was so hurt by his evil deeds in Heaven and the 1/3 of the Angels that fell with him. I can't even imagine. But when the Lord decided He was going to make Man in His own image...His very own children....He decided he wanted them to have the choice to love Him. They would not be forced. You know the story. So Satan was allowed to tempt Adam and Eve and they fell away from the Lord. Originally the Earth was made to be a garden where the Lord walked with us in the cool of the day. A paradise where we neither toiled or had pain or grew old. But after we fell, it was turned over to Satan and the dark angels and it would be a place of toil, pain, death and troubles and the Lord would no longer walk among us. But the Lord loved us so much that He sent (AN: I remember SENT in John 3:16) His only begotten Son to redeem us by conquering Satan and the dark angels. The battle for our souls is still playing out, though Jesus has already had victory. When Jesus returns He returns as a Lion, as a King, and He will claim His Reward and devour His enemies. Satan will be placed in a holding cell with his angels until the 1000 years is over on Earth, and then Satan and his dark angels will be loosed one more time for a final battle and then thrown into the fire pit for eternity. You need to trust the Lord with the timing and the reasons for allowing this to play out. Never question Him. Praise Him and Thank Him in everything. And in the things you don't understand or can't thank Him for then just trust. Tell Him you trust Him. And if you can't, pray to Him asking for help and guidance in learning to trust Him more. I hope this helped a little. Like I said earlier, I am super tired tonight and I just hope my comments are making sense! LOL ;)",

As far as the the Garden of Eden, Tree of Life, I am just starting a new in depth study under my Teacher, with the Holy Spirit as my guide, on the very subject. It could take quite awhile to finish it he has me starting several other studies at this time and I am having to catch up with the rest of the students in his class. That being said, I also must work in the studies for my videos which are quite in depth and take weeks to months in preparation. I am waiting on the Lord right now as I am overwhelmed and am in need of His counsel so I don't get pulled in too many directions. Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts with me. I truly appreciate it. Again, I am sorry if I misspoke. Miss Amy.",

It makes sense to me that we might be different from the rest of the population since we are from another planet. The skeletal design here does not match ours. I am RH neg also.
