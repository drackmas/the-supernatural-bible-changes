Long story short, from here on out in our faith lives you need to trust me. If you are a regular listening tithing congregant regarding scriptures and God's Word you'll hopefully will do that.

First of all I don't believe they used bottles in those days for wine. They may not have even had bottles. They put wines in wineskins. That is why it is called wineskins.
