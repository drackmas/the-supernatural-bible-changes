Desc: What if rapture doesn't happen when you expect it to? Do you hunker down and prepare for what is to come? Where does it leave you spiritually? These are some of the things we should keep in mind since prophecy has somewhat blinded us already with the supernatural changes. We don't know if future events will be the same way.

        "content": "Serious Question for pre-tribulation believers: If the rapture happened at another point in the tribulation than you expected, how would it impact your faith? If your miscalculation left you in a place where you had to endure some or most of the tribulation, how would you receive it? Would you just see it as a simple misunderstanding and and just hunker down? Would you hold on to your view and just believe tribulation had not started since you are still on earth even though the world is literally falling apart around you (rocks falling from heaven, world war III fully declared, etc)? If say most of the other end time prophecies were fulfilled and you were still here, at what point would you reconsider it a misunderstanding, and how would you perceive your standing in God's Kingdom? These are just some questions for curiosity sake, and I am not trying to imply one thing or another about your view.",

        "content": "So not trying to start a fight here, but I have realized that a pre-trib doctrinal view of the scriptures is really at odds with a lot of the points that I raise in this group. One of my issues with this conflict of ideas is how do we reconcile the very obvious prophetic events we are experiencing? The lying signs and wonders of and the Strong Delusion of 2nd Thess. 2. The Times and Laws changing from Dan. 7 All of these events are happening already and seem painfully obvious to me. Furthermore if they are happening, then they have to be achieved by the one opposing Christ, the AC...as per the scripture, but the pre-trib view by definition would suggest all of these supernatural events are not prophetic fulfillments of 2 Thess and Daniel 7 ... Because in the pre-trb view would suggest believers won't witnessing any of these lying signs and wonders or times and laws changing...correct? I am trying to understand how the pre-trib view reconciles with what we are experiencing.",

        "content": "\"My understanding is that the feasts are prophetic. The spring feasts were fulfilled when the Spirit came on Pentecost (Shavuot.) The fall feasts are yet to be fulfilled. They are Trumpets, Atonement, and Sukkot. Jesus\u2019 return is always synonymous with trumpets being sounded in scripture. Trumpets (the feast) is the one holiday Jews don\u2019t miss because they expect the Messiah (earthly king) to come on the feast of Trumpets. When Jesus told the Jews that no one would know the day nor the hour of his return, they knew exactly what he meant. Trumpets is the only feast referred to in that way by the Jews. If the appointed day is cloudy, it automatically moves to the next day. Atonement is God\u2019s wrath being poured out on the earth. THAT is what we are rescued from, same as Noah being rescued from the flood. Atonement is the tribulation. Tabernacles is when God comes to tabernacle with us. It\u2019s the Millennial reign of Christ.\"",

        "content": "For what it is worth, the whole \"feast\" narrative is new to me. It may have always been there but written differently so as not so much to emphasize how \"God commands us to keep the feasts\". I do think there are definite patterns in the Jewish traditions that model the eschatological timeline though. I do not dismiss that. Where I am coming from mainly is that how we interpreted many of these \"events\" may have turned out to more like Spiritually fulfilled rather than literally. I tend to think God's wrath is God's judgment on earth. I think the last 7 years include a period where God judges those who claimed to be the Church or the Body of Christ. I think during these 7 years..perhaps the last 3.5 years...many who who may have been once called to His Body, make a choice(s) that clarify where the heart really ever was. If that decision(s) falls in line with their own understanding by their thoughts or actions then they befall God's judgement on earth...they become \"the walking dead\" or the \"who are living eternally\" before the earth is replaced. So this is a very different viewpoint on end times eschatology, but I think the way the Bible changes and M.E. have played out, I think we shouldn't expect such a visceral end times scene as from what we imagine from reading Revelations literally. I was all mostly written to figuratively represent what happens spiritually to the remnant church on earth.",

I doubt seriously if they would use a cloned animal for a sacrifice. It sure seems like a problem if they did. There is no need for a sacrifice anymore. Jesus died for our sins, the ultimate sacrifice. Many were blinded to that until the fullness of the gentiles comes in. I believe that has been accomplished. The last tribe that had not heard, killed the guy who came to preach the Good News to them. That was maybe two years ago. I am not good on guessing times, as I read so much. The tribe killed the missionary, before he ever set foot on the beach. This is all from memory, but this is what I remember.\"",
