Desc: Following an 8.2 magnitude in the Ring of Fire beneath Lombok Island and Figi causing the tectionic plates to move and adjust, all crazy has broken loose in the Ring with over 70 earthquakes in 48 hours and more to come.  The "Big One" is forecasted for the West Coast we wonder what it would be like to have a 9.0 along the California coastline.
