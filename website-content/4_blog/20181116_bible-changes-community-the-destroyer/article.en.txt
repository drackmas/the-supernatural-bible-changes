Desc: Mandela Effect Bible Changes. Bibles are changing supernaturally. Even dusty bibles on dusty shelves. Think back to when Moses went to the Pharaoh to ask him to let God's people go. Do you remember when everyone's first born sons were killed? Do you remember the destroyer doing the deed? I don't.

        "content": "Do remember an what passed over the houses? I remember an angel passed over them, not God. Here's the Exodus verse again in the NKJV so we can see the reverential capitilzation. Notice it says \"and when He sees the blood\".It literally says God passed over the houses and and killed the firstborn Egyptians but then stopped \"the destroyer\" from killing the houses marked with blood. This makes no sense to me because it sounds like he is \"the destroyer\" but isn't because He stops \"the destroyer\". If God killed the firstborn then what did the destroyer do?For the Lord will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the Lord will pass over the door and not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to strike you. Exodus 12:23 NKJV",
