His Love is never ending, His Mercy can always be found. He is our foundation and our Rock, where all Hope is found. He so Loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, The Lamb who was slain, Holy Holy is His Name above all Names. Whom Son sets free is free indeed, for He is the King of Kings.",
