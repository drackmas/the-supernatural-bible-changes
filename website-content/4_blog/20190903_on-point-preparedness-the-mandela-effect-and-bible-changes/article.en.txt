Desc: Thanks to Mike for establishing his opinion on the Bible changes.  The video presents multiple straw man points to make his case, but at least there is no more guessing on where this self proclaimed teacher stands. I still respect Mike for continuing to preach the gospel in much of his work, but cannot disagree more with this video.

What we do see is that our past history is now a lie and things have been supernaturally changing as we speak. We think it's the lying signs and wonders that satan causes in 2nd Thessalonians Chapter 2 that happens before the antichrist is revealed. To go even further scriptures clearly told us that everyone is appointed to die once and then comes Judgement. That doesn't work with multiple versions of the same person. At least with scriptures changing along with this, we look at Amos 8:11 where it says, \"The days cometh sayeth the Lord, that I will send a famine in the land. Not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\" As bad as scriptures has become as a whole and the lack of people being alarmed by this, it can only be a famine for hearing the words of the Lord.",

So in this video it's titled All Creation Awaits THIS Moment in the Near Future and I had referenced Isaiah 11 and it says \"The wolf shall lie down or dwell with the lamb.\" And the comments just utterly blew up with a ton of people saying I was deceived because scriptures should say the Lion shall lay down with the Lamb, and I need to start investigating the mandela effect because the words of the bible is changing.",

Going further you only have to look at the beginning of John to see that The Word of God can't be the bible. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. Skipping a few verses it then states that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Considering that after he died on the cross he would then be raised 3 days later, spend some time with his disciples, and then be seated on the right hand side of God until he returns for us after tribulations, there is no possible way that God's Word could be the bible at all.",

Good kind hearted people\u2026people who love Jesus and follow Jesus\u2026and are looking into this Mandela Effect some more than others. I'm not saying completely ditch this Mandela Effect if you just want to investigate it and you look at secular things that are changing by all means you know go ahead, but you really need to reconsider when you start to say that God's Word, His scripture which the Lord your God said in his own word that it is unbreakable, that you would go against him and teach other people that they need to put down their bibles. Teach other people that what it says isn't what it really said and it might be this or that. This is a serious serious thing because the bible says that people who do such things it is for their own destruction. That is a stern warning. Allot of people aren't going to like that but even though this doesn't sound like a loving message I do this because I love you and many of you are going astray and it needs to stop.",

The Mandela Effect is basically the complete rewrite of history that also includes the bible. Without the Bible and the prophecies warning us that these changes would take place, would not only make the Mandela Effect seem meaningless, but we would have no clues or any ideas of the times we are in.",
