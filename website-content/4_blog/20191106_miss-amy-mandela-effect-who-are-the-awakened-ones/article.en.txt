(1) I believe that the movie called The Mandela Effect will be used to strengthen, the seemingly only explanation for the phenomenon of the ME, as being a simulation. It will be \"space aliens\" who will convince almost everyone that they are the gods that created us as virtual players in a virtual universe, and have returned to save us from some extinction level event. What will appear to be \"the rapture\" will actually be when the tares are snatched up and cast into the fire. They will then require all to receive the mark of the beast which will link people to a super quantum computer and together be able to modify DNA so that you will (allegedly) live disease free for ever. Revelation 9 talks about how men shall seek death but it will flee from them. Gates and Zuckerman claim to have the cure for all disease! Did anyone really think they were talking about a vaccine? This will also allow people to create their own worlds where they can fly, be rich, be a god of a virtual planet of their own etc. And the masses will line up for it even more so than they did for i-Phones. The very few of us that weren't \"raptured\" and hadn't taken the mark, will be hunted down and killed unless God protects us. This is the tribulation that Jesus said HE would return immediately after. Matthew 24:29. HE will rescue us at that time, before the \"wrath of God\" which isn't the same as the tribulation. (2) When the bible talks about Israel, it's talking about the people of the tribes of Israel. And it has been proven biblically, historically, and geologically, that the ten \"lost tribes\" of Israel are the Germanic, Celtic, Scandinavian, Anglo Saxon, and kindred peoples of today. Paul Cantnor of the Jefferson Airplane wrote a song about how everyone else knows their histories as a race, but us. The song's name is 'White Boy'. Pastor Pete Peters did a sermon you can see on YT called 'Roots From Abraham to America'. (3) God commanded us ALL to \"prove all things\", and to \"be not deceived\", so I do my absolute best to do them. And the easiest thing I ever had to prove to myself in my life was that the earth is not flat. There is SOOOO much proof that it's not flat it's ridiculous. And that's totally disregarding any info from NASA. But there's not any evidence, forget proof, that we live on a FE. It was NEVER believed by anyone except the certifiably insane until very recently. The CIA's program of dumbing down the people to the incredible level of today had to be accomplished in order to create the FE cult and make all real truth seekers look as stupid as it's members do. FE is a big turd in the punch bowl of truth. If anybody reading this wants proof on this topic, I'll be glad to share what I discovered.",

Remember he told us that many are called (the multitude or the Greater Sheepfold still back on earth), but few are chosen (the 144,000 or however many that stands for or the Lesser Sheepfold that are here). He chose us before the foundation of the Earth. He is determined that we shall be in relationship with him and is patient for us. We have been gathered in physically and have been marked as the Lord's. We must now, with help of the Holy Spirit, reach all of us and gather ourselves in spiritually as the Bride. Part of that work will be to get some of us to Rededicate. He will spew out anything that is lukewarm. He wants to be our Superstar Groom, without us getting our eyes off the ultimate prize of a real relationship with our Father. Anything less, he doesn't want us. There is still so much work to be done within the Bride itself. All of us need to be filled and working with the Holy Spirit at all times. Keep your eyes off this satanic illusion as best you can. This is not your circus. These are not your monkeys. Remember, when Jesus arrives, he finds not even one person here to save. He looks and looks but there is no one. So he destroys everyone and everything. And then he breaks us free to follow him home to the Mount of Sion for the Marriage Supper!

And at the very same time the Big and Little Dippers that represent the Greater and Lesser Sheepfolds were in the middle of a major sign with Draco and the Polaris (Jesus) star foretelling us even more about the end time prophecy. What more did we need? The scriptures were finally opened and revealed to us, stars, sun, moon, planets all aligning for us to know and recognize the truth....and then the Bride goes off in all directions running to and fro after crazy, unbiblical doctrine.

        "content": "I have noticed over time that you listen to everybody and trust how the Lord speaks to them. A rare and beautiful quality. There is much to share about my journey. Too much to be confined to a YT comment but I will say this with regards to what I observe. Loving heart! Yes! That is what is most important that I see disappear once the enemy clicks his fingers to impose fear upon someone. We know fear is of the enemy. Those words come off the lips of some but when they should remember them they forget them completely. What are they doing when they do react with fear? Trying to hold onto their own salvation like it is something they must fight for and is not a merciful act after all? Would even the sealed 144 need to do that if it was a fight? What are people willing to do to fight for that salvation? Crush others for it? Is that what Jesus really wanted? How hard will they crush? Will they care that they have? Rev 11 mentions something about a measuring rod. What are those witnesses measuring? It's the 144. Those worshipping in the temple at the alter. How are the 144 going to treat them, therefore have that ability to treat anyone? Something to consider. If certain affected Christians want to hold onto a fallacy that only lovers of truth and genuine born again Christians see the Bible changing they are actually hurting the mission. People do not like to hear they are not lovers of truth or not born again when they believe they are, especially those in countries putting their life on the line for Jesus. One might not get past that insult and listen to the actual important message. That is why I love the message in this video so much. If people let go of these outdated misplaced ideas, we can all get to a better place of helping who we are here to help which is our entrusted responsibility. We see the Bible changes because we are the sealed 144. That's the full story. That is mercy, not a reward for us or a punishment to those who don't see. We are a promised prophesy being fulfilled because God loves everyone so much. Also if we have full knowledge another is affected and passionately defending the truth, how can on that theory it be justified to throw anyone out as the two witnesses have been? Surely God must have rewarded us also for being lovers of truth, born again and \"special\". It's very disappointing what we have witnessed. People are not looking at things from all angles to make sure that everything fits before they open their mouth or take drastic actions that is hard to recover from. Hearts have become hard within this harvest but it would be nice to know we can recover from the spoilage. With God all things are possible. We are to be an example to all and how is being a fractured ununited army for God a good example? The Lord said to me recently...I don't expect a perfect army...But I do expect a united one. After everything He has done for us I don't think that is too much to ask. It is time for us to assemble and get on the same page. As to my journey and what the Lord speaks to me I hope others will reach out and want to know. Genuinely want to know. Eagerly want to know. So much they actually just listen before telling me how they know it all and have got this all figured out so much that they don't need what the Lord tells the two witnesses. The measuring rod is currently in place and functioning. Overall results right now aren't looking great.",

        "content": "Yes, I completely agree! I've been treated worse by those who are affected than by my own family and friends. I rarely make comments anymore or participate in live stream hangouts. I've been affected for almost 4 years and used to think I found some fellowship with others on YT. I couldn't have been more wrong. As far as the 2 Witnesses, there's so many different theories, religious doctrines and personal beliefs that makes it nearly impossible to navigate through. I personally don't subscribe to any of them because they are nothing more than expectations and preconceived notions that we've been indoctrinated to expect. I've come to conclude that we should expect the unexpected. The ME should serve as an example to that. I suspect the 2 Witnesses will be ordinary people living among this generation who understand what it's like to live as a sinner. I'm sure the Lord has His ways of revealing their identity to them in ways we may not understand. Jesus lived among people as a man so I would expect the 2 Witnesses to be in like manner. I'm anxiously awaiting for someone to step forth with something extraordinary. With the bible changing, there has to be some sort of \"supernatural\" provision given to someone, more than likely, one of the Witnesses. Thoughts?",

They are all waiting for their preconceived ideas to show up that is different to the next person's. But the rest of the flock would not choose who the 144 are actually are either...so same principles, just different people applying them. We are at the closing chapter of this story now. We all have pretty much have at least pondered are we the 144 and time is proving it to be true. Heaven forbid 2 from among them with eyes wide open were given a bit more to see. My experiences of betrayal, exile, and the most hurtful actions from certain 144 is just history repeating. They can't see that's exactly what would happen to the two witnesses because their mind feeds them justifications to be the ones to do it. I pray for them when they realise what they have done. But it comes down to the fact, if you still have got it in you to hurt anybody, eventually you are going to hurt the wrong people. Still more purification is needed to rise above a basic Christian violation. I've got the hardest job in the world and only one by my side so it's a little heartbreaking. If only they knew. If only they would take the time to know. But I know how this goes! You practically beg between the lines for someone to care enough to listen and ask yet nobody steps forward. Everybody goes quiet. Or messages get blocked. Threads delted. It all a little too controversial for someone to use their heart on this matter it seems. I think they themselves have said the same thing about the Pharisees and Jesus \ud83e\udd14",

I have to disagree that changes aren't still happening as I continue to see them happen, not just recognize them. Every time CERN messes with the history here it changes things like land masses and Jim Nabors dying twice since I woke up, and much more, and I absolutely am not flipping around on different planets. My husband and sister continue on this journey with me on this mirror planet and are excellent witnesses and we do compare notes. The scriptures foretell of the Mandela Effect but do not mention numerous earths where we are living out different lives. It is simply not how the Lord does things. The scriptures are full of twin, evil/good, parables and outright examples of how the Lord accomplishes His work on Earth and in the Universe. Even the people here that look and seem like people from Earth, are NOT those people in some other realm. They are separate beings. They are Edomite Twins that either Satan has conjured with majik tricks or the Lord has trapped here himself for the endtime destruction that is prophesied in the bible. I am concerned that you are going down one of the popular roads about the theory of the Mandela Effect. I pray you stay in prayer, your bible, and close to the Holy Spirit so you not be led a stray. You are struggling against principalities that want your very soul. God Bless You.",
