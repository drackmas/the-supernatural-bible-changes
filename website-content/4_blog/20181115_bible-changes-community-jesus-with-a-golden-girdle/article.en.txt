Desc: Mandela Effect. Bible Changes. Bibles are changing supernaturally. Even dusty bibles on dusty shelves. Scriptures now show Jesus to wear a GOLDEN GIRDLE in Revelations KJV. I remember this to be a golden sash. What do you remember?

I believe we have to consider the idea that \"\"blessed assurance\" is misleading. That we cannot just assume people that seem to bare good fruit on the outside have fully worked out their salvation and \"secured\" it. We can know them by their fruit, but truthfully only God knows if they are secure in heaven to come, for only He knows the thoughts and intentions in the deepest corner of our heart. This is not meant to plant doubt in everyone reading this, but I believe we have to confront the ugly possibility that the Bible changes being consumed at face value may be reversing the spiritual destiny of our brethren while them being mostly unaware. We can say about the above illustration, \"well the author is not at fault for he was only basing it off of scripture\", but is it reasonable to assume God will say the same?",

When the Bible is being preached with no filter or discernment, BLASPHEMY will eventually be spoken of our God intentional or not (as the illustrations I have posted today have shown).

So many anti-christs is not necessarily referring to individuals who claim to be Christ, but to anyone who is opposed to the one true anointed of God. So yes the spirit of anti-christ can indeed be applied to organizations and groups of people, and there can be many anti-christ\u2019s as individuals. However, there is a person we need to be on the lookout for and he is the son of perdition. I also believe that the false prophet is an individual as well, but I will save that for another time.",

    {
        "attrs": [],
        "content": "I appreciate your measured response, and like I have said, I am always opened to be taught. I do know what you mean as in not having the time to properly respond to all aspects of the scriptures that deal with this subject. I feel there is so much more i need to address as well. With that said, I have noted elsewhere that the prophetic words given in scripture are special in that they often cloaked in a allegorical and metaphorical manner. <br><br>From Strongs, we have a whole range of meaning provided from multiple sources meant to give a wide range of possible interpretations. What this boils down to is that the translators knew each word has a built spectrum of meaning in many cases when it comes to prophetic texts of the Bible. There is effectively a \"spectrum of meaning\" for each word where on the one side is the most concrete literal meaning and on the other is an esoteric hardly understandable meaning. I believe the M.E. proved the hard literal interpretation is folly (another post topic perhaps). Furthermore, I believe in this prophetic moment, the HS is at work to reveal the actual meaning of the prophetic text now that the seal has been opened.<br><br>So take for example the term \"man of sin\" (all lower case mind you)...well that very phrase indicates a \"descriptive idea\" rather than a literal personal pronoun because no one is actually born from the womb of \"sin\". So man G444 on the hard literal interpretation = a masculine noun describing a man, \"a man faced human being\" to be exact.<br><br>But on a less literal scale in the outline of biblical usage it can mean: \"a human being, whether male or female , generically, to include all human individuals ,with reference to two fold nature of man, body and soul ,in the plural, people \"So in the context of the phrase \"man of sin\" which clearly is more of an idea than a specific person, it is actually more appropriate to consider the usage of G444 in a LESS literal form.Next take \"sin\" G266. The most literal interpretation is \"missing the mark\", or \"failing to hit the mark\"A expanded definition based on its biblical usage could mean:\"to err, be mistaken ,to miss or wander from the path of uprightness and honour, to do or go wrong ,that which is done wrong, sin, an offense, a violation of the divine law in thought or in act , collectively, the complex or aggregate of sins committed either by a single person or by many \"So together, these words could mean: a single man who has missed the mark, and in violation of God's law,OR less literally it could mean ALL human individuals who have wondered from the path of uprightness and honor, and who are in violation of the divine law in THOUGHT or ACT.<br><br>What is interesting about the range of possible meaning in the text is that where you end up leaning depends largely on what you prefer it means. Like you, for several decades of my life, the single figure idea of antichrist has been ingrained into my eschatological view through teachers, study, and end times geopolitics information, so it is very hard for me to disengage from that perspective. However i believe that is why God allowed the ME, so that we could feel more comfortable letting go of that sacred cow. So this brief exercise can apply to pretty much all of the prophetic texts which I too do not have the time to go into now.<br><br>However by simply moving within a wider latitude of meaning hopefully after a prayerful moment with the HS, you may start to understand why I have leaned harder on this less popular method to understand the prophetic text. Furthermore, as mentioned above, I believe being a witness to the M.E. and changes is the key having the grace needed to re-read the prophecies as so. <br><br>This is really a key point.<br><br>You see Times and Laws have changed, and the lying signs and wonders/Strong Delusion has arrived. At minimum this tells us that the Antichrist is NOT the single figure standing in a temple openly casting spells and causing wonders for the world to gaze at from. So the very fact that Times and laws have changed and the lying signs and wonders are playing out should indicate to those curious about prophecy that maybe we should reconsider the traditional view of the single figure man of sin/perdition. Don't you think? For me, i believe the ME not only forces us to do this, but that through that wider prophetic lens, it has led to confirmation that the AC speaks more to the spirit of man that lives against Christ whether he does it overtly, secretly, or ignorantly...so for me YES the AC has been revealed or who we know of as the \"man of sin\" is staring at us in the mirror when we choose life without Christ.",

One thing i would present to you as food for thought is if times and laws are changing, and the lying signs and wonders are already upon us...then does it make scriptural and/or logical sense that all of it could and is being achieved by someone or something OTHER THAN 1) the \"king\" that of arises after the 10 kings . Dan. 7 and/or 2) the one whose comes by the power of Satan. 2 Thess 2?<br><br>If you do not think these lying signs and wonders do not relate to said scriptures above, then by what logic or scripture would you say they are explained by?<br><br>To me, this is a major, if not most significant reason why the \"single figure end times ruler\" interpretation fails. There are other reasons why that form of interpretation fails, but this is a huge one.What I am noticing in the seeing community is that because we don't see the single figure evil king of the end times we try to play down the significance or relevance of the lying signs and wonders.<br><br>I have heard everything from the idea that the lying signs and wonders are just a horrible distraction to it is just the build up to revealing who this character really is. The problem with these conclusions is that they must overlook a very serious logical flaw. Namely that scripture tells us that the \"coming,presence or also revelation\" (G3952) of this character is directly related to the actions that he does. 2 Thess 29 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,his \"coming\" G952 (coming,presence or also revelation) is \"after\" G2596 (down from, through out ,according to, toward, along ,according to one's own) SO his revelation of his presence or his appearance is according to and through \"the working of Satan\". AKA the lying signs and wonders will indicate who is or at minimum who he is NOT.<br><br>In other words, there is nothing that indicates 1) there are multiple occasions in the end time of lying signs and wonders and 2) there is no indication of a \"build up to\" or a \"phase 1 then phase 2\" for this prophecy to manifest. To the contrary, they are inextricably entwined. One does not occur without the other...there are the signs and there is a reveal and they relate to one another fundamentally. Therefore what this indicates is that because they \"go together\" what this tells us is at minimum is that the reveal is NOT the single figure \"wizard\" character (for lack of a better term) we imagined him to be.",

I think we are in the early innings of this process, and that the restrainer has not yet been taken out of the way, and the lawless one has therefore not yet been revealed.<br><br>Ok so one of my biggest counter points is this.Matthew 24:14-21 King James Version (KJV)14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)16 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:17 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:18 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.19 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.Starting with verse 14 Jesus says \u201cand then shall the end come.\u201d<br><br>Jesus then gives us something very specific to look for that has already been prophesied. I find it hard to believe given the gravity of the situation that Jesus would be giving us some fulfillment of prophecy to look for that would be esoteric in meaning. He then follows it up with very practical advice for those living in the area at that time. GO don\u2019t waste time, don\u2019t go back and get things just head for the mountains. This is not a parable. When Jesus gave hidden meanings it was in parable form. I don\u2019t think he would point to some prophecy being fulfilled in a debatable esoteric manner then followed directly by specific and urgent instructions. To me this is inconsistent with the urgency of the situation.I have to leave this right here because I need to prepare for tonight\u2019s livestream.",
