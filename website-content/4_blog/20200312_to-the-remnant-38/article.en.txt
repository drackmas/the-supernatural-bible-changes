Let us be as a orchard that bears good fruit. <br>For He is the King of Kings, Author of our Salvation. <br>As sheep gone astray we were once lost, though now we are as found.<br>The Good Shepard who watches His flock without ceasing and with loving care.<br>Even as David defended his sheep from the bears and snares of the wilderness.<br>So is our Savior, always there Mighty to Save those who seek His face.<br>While it can be found, before the final trumpet sounds.<br>Those with ears to hear and eyes to see, that the end is near.<br>Must be steadfast as a running river of water always moving, flowing and growing, not as a pond that is stagnant and still.<br>Yet being unmovable as hill and mountain top reaching for the sun.<br>Knowing with Him the battle is already won.<br>This world is not our home.<br>We are in it, but not of it. <br>Separated as day is from night.<br>Shining as stars so bright.",
