Just as lies hate The Truth. For the Truth sets us free. Let us than leave behind the chains of our old captivity. Going forward in freedom, knowing He is Truth, the Light, and the Way, <br>He is our Salvation and everlasting Life. We will know them by there fruits. <br>So let us than continue to seek to do good as He Is Good. Not returning hate for hate, or anger for strife. Rather walking and being ambassadors of the Light. For He is The Light of the world. Whom dwells in us.",
