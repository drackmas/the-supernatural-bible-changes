So are they.<br>Forever to stay with Him.<br>The end from the beginning so it shall be.<br>Let us ask Him, what it is we do not see. <br>For the time soon shall be.<br>Behold He tells us all things beforehand. <br>There is no mystery on earth we cannot know. <br>Yet many mysteries in Heaven that no man can perceive.<br>By Him alone, we have been given The Truth. <br>He knew us even in our youth. <br>The reverence and fear of the Creator of all living things, the Heavens and all the earth. <br>Is the beginning of wisdom. <br>For He created them all, the great and the small. <br>Who was chosen among you? Was it David, or was it Saul.<br>In the eyes of the Creator who is mighty? <br>Let us not appoint ourselves a king of man. <br>To serve the arm of flesh again. <br>Rather, in Spirit and Truth, forgetting not the lesson of our youth. <br>David took several stones, yet only needed one. <br>For The Heavenly Fathers glory to be done. <br>He takes the feeble and the small, He chooses the meek over the tall <br>Few choose to listen, yet many are called. <br>Looking on heart of man He sees all things. <br>He can read the heart, as man can read a book. <br>To Him there is no mystery found in you. <br>For He molded you like clay. <br>Even from the womb He knew your name. <br>His Love remains, when all else fails. He prevails. <br>The Truth is not hidden or in a place that cannot be found. <br>The Rock of your salvation is your solid ground. <br>For soon the King of Kings will come. <br>In all His His glory His Will Shall be done.",
