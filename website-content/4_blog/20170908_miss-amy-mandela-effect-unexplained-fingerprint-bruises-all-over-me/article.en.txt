Desc: This video was made in response to BlueBeard's video about bruises he's been getting and abductions he's been going through.  I had been getting a lot of bruising on my legs and arms recently that were unexplained so I thought I'd also share my experiences for comparison and record making.

But my bruises over the past week were horrid and actually extremely painful. Several doctors have seen them during checkups but they are not concerned about them. I don't know how this could be imagination...I mean, others can see them...so there is no doubt they are there and you know whether or not you fell, tripped or bumped into something hard enough to leave a bruise. And they don't look like regular bruises and they are shaped strangely. No getting around that either. So it IS something. But what I just don't know either.",

Thanks for thinking of me. yes, I am covered by the blood of Jesus Christ, praise God. But we all need to take heed and be prepared for spiritual attack and whatever else while we're here. This mirror planet has been produced by Cern and Satan and there is all matter of evil about. We must have our armor on at all times.

No worries as I see you are awakened and have now been moved by the recently unveiled scriptures about Bozrah and the 144,000.....Jesus our Lord will break us out , though at the last minute. So hang in there Brother. Be on watch for Him. He wants us to stay \"awake\" with him, just as he wanted in the garden with the disciples, though they disappointed him and fell asleep. This awake is different. It is a 24 hour a day awake. Even in our sleep we should be in a state of waiting for our King. Stay in the Holy Spirit, allow Him to dwell fully within you.

His is awful. And he remembers the abduction. I just remember a hand over my mouth. And my husband heard someone in the house. I don't claim to know what caused the bruising, just open to ideas. As for your world not having demons, maybe you would call them aliens or whatever. What matters is being taken against your will in the dead of the night and being held down to the point that it leaves bruises all over you. If that is what is happening, I want to know. And if it is happening to others I want them to know they are not alone and there is a way to take control of the situation and not be a victim. The truth sets you free.",
