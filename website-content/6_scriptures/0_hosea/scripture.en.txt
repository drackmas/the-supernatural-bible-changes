  verse: Hosea 4:6
  scripture: 'My people are **destroyed** for lack of knowledge: because thou **hast** rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou **shalt be no priest to me**; seeing thou hast forgotten the **law of they God**, I will also forget thy children.'
  notes: |
    My people perish for lack of knowledge. "hast" vs "hath". I don't think priest should be there at all.
    
    The law of God and it's variations promote the Hebrew Roots Movement.
