  verse: Revelations 8:12
  scripture: >
    And the fourth angel sounded, and the
    third part of the sun was smitten, and
    the third part of the moon, and the
    third part of the stars; so as the third
    part of them was darkened, and the day
    shone not for a third part of it, and
    the night likewise.

  verse: Revelations 12:9
  scripture: 'And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the **Devil, and Satan**, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out **into** the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.'
  notes: |
    Using both the Devil and Satan almost makes you think this is two instead of one angel here. Also the word "into" doesn't seem right either.

  verse: Revelations 22:10
  scripture: 'And he **saith** unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this **book**: for the time is at hand.'
  notes: |
    And he **sayeth** unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this **book**: for the time is at hand.
    
    Saith is a miss-spelled version of sayeth from the KJV. I'm not sure of if "this book" was added here or if it was a form of "scroll" at some point in the past.

  verse: Revelations 22:18
  scripture: 'For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this **book**, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this **book**:'
  notes: 'For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this **book** (book???), If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this **book** (book?):'
- 
  verse: Revelations 22:19
  scripture: 'And if any man shall take away from the words of the **book** of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this **book**.'
  notes: |
    And if any man shall take away from the words of the **book** (book again???) of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this **book**.
    
    Maybe it was something along the lines of saying prophecy instead of book? I wasn't very knowledgeable of Revelations before the Mandela Effect happened, but I knew of the warning that we were not to knowingly change scriptures.
