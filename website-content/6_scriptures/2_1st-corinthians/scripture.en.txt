  scripture: 'And now abideth faith, hope, **charity**, these three; but the greatest of these is **charity**.'
  notes: >
    Is it Faith hope and charity...or is it
    Faith hope and love? I can give to
    charity to make myself look better. I
    could also do so to get tax breaks. This
    verse always said LOVE!
