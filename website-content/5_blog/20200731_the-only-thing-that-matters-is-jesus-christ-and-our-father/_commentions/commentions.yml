    *That's what satan wants. To go so far to take everything away to the point where we would not care anymore. Trying to find the one thing to make us reject Jesus.*
    
    Indeed. I would add: is to make us hate our Creator by completely turn the creation in a mess against us. The same emotion he have toward him at the beginning rejecting to serve God, he want human beings to feel that hatred he felt.
