Desc: A video recalling my anniversary weekend with my husband and what I learned about visiting old haunts and favorite places  (Earth's counterparts) while here on Bozrah.  Let's just say "There's no place like home."

We probably should have gone somewhere new that we might be able to make a new memory on this planet or something.

You're just not going to be able to get it out of your mind that you are not really in that place and you're going to be able to see the differences and even minute changes…and even if you're not even thinking it it's going to be there on the subconscious level bothering you and maybe what we can do while we're here is make new memories that we can take back to earth with us.
