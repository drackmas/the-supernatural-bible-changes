Desc: Testimony of someone's belief about the supernatural bible changes and the mandela effect. He believes that this content will be censored as well so I am also going to mirror it here to share what may possibly be going on. That Cern would cause all the wickedness through portals to the satanic spiritual side? Possibly black magic being used.

After asking me stupid questions like \"How do I remember Fruit Loops being spelled\"? etc. he eventually told me what the Mandela effect is. At first I thought It was nothing more than people with memory problems and science fiction nerds crying over an alternate version of their favorite movies that change the most memorable parts to them. I researched it briefly after hearing about it online and remember seeing a clip from main stream FOX News about it in late 2016. I could care less about the spelling of a product, or a movie line.",

        "content": "In 2017, I was researching the Bible (an on and off hobby of mine) at the time, When I came across a video on YouTube in the related videos section titled: The Lion Will Lay Down With The Lamb. I remembered hearing this line so many times as a child attending sunday school. I even remember reading it with my class many times in the 1990's when I attended catholic school for over a decade. I clicked on this video and much to my surprise the video claimed that the line/verse \"The Lion Will lay Down with the Lamb\" now does not exist in any version of the Bible (ever). A day before I came across this video I was at my mothers home and watched the 1977 movie \"Jesus of Nazareth\" and heard the line quoted in the movie so I figured this was just fake news. I figured it was a video uploaded to scare people into insanity.",

I was surprised to see this, and figured it is a new change and the guy that made the YouTube video on this thinks it's every bible cause he's nuts. I went through my father's closet of dusty boxes and found an old bible my grandfather passed down to my father printed in 1958 and much to my horror it also read: \"The Wolf also shall dwell with the lamb\". I quickly went online so I could download the video I seen about this that first brought this to my attention and once I found it my computer was bombarded with ads and pop ups like I was using a public computer in the 1990's. It was the first and last time that ever happened on my Windows 7 PC to date.",

The first listing to pop up was a picture of a wolf laying down with lambs in front of a picture of a lion laying down with a lamb. Right next to the picture it reads that no lion is allowed in heaven and goes on to say why sighting bible passages etc. I did not ask a question, I just searched something. (strange)",

I also noticed that many pictures of a lion laying with a lamb had a quote next to the picture that read: \"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb\" contrary to the picture right next to it. I have since found hundreds of songs, television show clips, sermons etc. that quote the verse as I remember it. I have also found out allot of mandela effects I never knew existed such as:",

The reason I do not believe this story and think it is a major cover up is because a topic so hot would still be known today. How is it in 2020 (a decade later) most people do not even know what the Mandela Effect is? Most don't know it is happening.",

From logo and product name changes to the spelling of well known peoples names etc. Proof it was the way many remember (that now never existed) continues to be found and even airs on prime time main stream television networks. Which only furthers the proof that many out there think it is still the same and are unaware that the changes that have occurred are more than just a new version change.

The door to hell they opened stays open because of the Anti-matter.
