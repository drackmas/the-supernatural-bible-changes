There is a certain number that is to be \"sealed\" before the earth as a whole is to be \"hurt\". Rev. 7.",

For at when that time comes \"the daily sacrifice and oblation\" will stop (Dan. 9:27) ...but it is not the literal sacrifice of animals or gift of oblation...it is the daily sacrifice and honor we make/give to the Lord to live a consecrated and holy life. When that process ends for a certain NUMBER (this correlates back to Rev. 7) of \"Christians\"...there is a 3.5 year march to the END.",

God had to set it up this way because He had to have a special protocol to END this age because at the END, a number of His followers would have to be taken out of this world without dying...whereas the equation was more simple for those who passed on before us (they already lived their \"trials and tribulations\").<br><br>He had to have a way to purify his remnant to be Holy and Consecrated and to be taken while still alive, and do this is in a way that would preserve free will for the rest of humanity. So He set up this \"special protocol\" given for the end times that would not be understood by the vast majority of the remaining church so that they would not run to God for fear of hell fire..He wants them to come to him out of repentance and contrition. This also helps explain who the \"False Prophet\" is. This is the corporate figure of ministers who have been unable to lead their flocks to walk in holiness and righteousness and/or who have accepted the blasphemous changes of the Bible as truth.",

For remember...not everyone who cries \"Lord Lord\" will come to the Father, but only those who do the will of the Father. Are we seeking His will and righteousness daily?",
