Let us remain, and be changed. <br>By the Power of His Name. For He shall Return, in a blink of our eyes, In a moment. <br>All the World, and every knee shall bow. <br>Let us then, give Him The Glory now.<br>For we know the Time is at Hand. <br>He is the Foundation, not built of sand, but of The Rock, which we stand, our Solid Ground. <br>Where All Hope is Found. <br>For His Word, remains Alive Today. Forever to stay. <br>Yet how can a tree grow in a world that it is upside down? <br>Can roots grow in the sky?<br>Can a waterfall run up a mountain and not go dry?<br>Can we live as though we died, and find life? Being born again, free from our sin.<br>He sets us free for He is the King of Kings.<br>For what is hidden, yet not seen and known by those who search.<br>How can we dwell on this earth, in a place that feels as a desert.<br>Seen but not yet reached, touched but not yet held. <br>Yet soon shall it be, in a moment not known but by Him alone.<br>With a promise we must not let go, holding onto the Truth.<br>Knowing there is no greater work to do than to freely share what has been given to you.<br>For there is none Greater than He who sits on the Heavenly Throne. <br>He is with us, even when we feel we are alone.<br>Mighty to Save, for there is All authority in His Name.",
