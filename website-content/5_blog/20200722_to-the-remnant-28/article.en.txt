We are fed.<br>Seeking Him each day, our hearts will not stray, for we have The Light.<br>We are not blinded, but are given sight for in the Truth we Abide. <br>Let us not let lies steal, and be a thorn in our side.<br>For there is no darkness that can overtake us, no evil that can destroy us.<br>For greater is He that in us than that which is in the world.<br>His Name is Almighty, The One who saves, He is our Refuge and Strength. <br>The King of Peace, The Author of Love.<br>For there is none greater than Him above.<br>Why should we fear, that which has come and is nearly here.<br>Are you not more valuable than a sparrow?<br>Beloved, do not fear the arrows, for He is our Shield.<br>Let us not yield in this season, for the harvest is many<br>yet the workers are few. <br>There is no other good to do, than to share that which has been given freely to you. For The Truth alone sets hearts free.<br>For its only be lies are we held in captivity. <br>For the battle is already won, our Victory is found in Him alone. <br>No flesh or blood, no power or principalities, no evil from above, or below.<br>Will ever remove Him from The Heavenly Throne.<br>What has been lost that has not been known? <br>By Him alone we walk, and breath.<br>By Him alone we live and see.<br>By Him alone we are set Free.<br>So Let us sing a new song, for it is unto Him we belong",
