Do not forget the serpent from the garden of Eden. For its fruit we should not eat. <br>The Tree of Knowledge, both Good and evil. The knowledge of evil only reaps death. Therefore let us seek the Truth and the Life. <br>Praying we maybe worthy to escape all things. <br>For He alone can take us up on eagles wings. <br>Now - a lion seeking who he may devour. <br>We were warned of this very hour. My 'people perish for lack of knowledge.' <br>Knowledge of whom? What can the knowledge of evil do for the body of Christ.<br>What fellowship shall Light have with darkness? Words of Truth now mingled with lies. <br>The well has been tainted. Guard your hearts and your eyes. <br>For he comes to kill, steal, and destroy, as a thief in the night.<br>Guard your hearts, do not let the temple of the Holy Spirit be broken into.<br>We do not walk in darkness, but by the power of our testimony, we are witnesses of The light.<br>For He is the Light of the world who dwells in us. <br>He alone is our Strength and Refuge. Let us not lean on pages written with ink or pens to again confirm salvation that we have received. <br>For the author of confusion, seeks to sow delusions.",

For He is with us, who then can stand against us?<br>If anyone lacks, in discernment, wisdom, Faith, Hope, Love, then ask your Heavenly Father above. Who is abundant in mercy and love, and a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. He does not give us a spirit of fear but of power Love and a sound mind. Let us walk in the spirit in these times. <br>‘Behold I am coming quickly and my reward is with me, to give to everyone according to there works it shall be.’<br>Let us then seek to do Good for He is Good.",
