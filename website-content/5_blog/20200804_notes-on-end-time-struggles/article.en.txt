Desc: Mandela Effect. Supernatural Bible Changes. Notes that I took on verses while looking at prophecy. Can't say this is complete, but I had thought it important enough to save. Maybe it will give someone different insights that I am not aware or thinking of.

Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that <strong>man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition</strong>; Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. Remember ye not that when I was with you I told you these things? And now ye know what witholdeth that <strong>he might be revealed in his time</strong>. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way (notice the word restrainer isn't here anymore). And then shall that <strong>Wicked be revealed</strong>, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: <strong>Even him, who's coming is after the working of Satan with all power and l-y-i-n-g s-i-g-n-s a-n-d w-o-n-d-e-r-s</strong>, And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause <strong>God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie</strong>: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\"",

And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it (huh?). And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.

But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation. And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man (so too shall be the second coming of the Son of God). They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded (planted and builded? Really?) ; But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed (It is the anti-christ who is revealed. Jesus doesn't need to be revealed. He will RETURN) . In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff (stuff wasn't in the KJV) in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. Remember Lot's wife. Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed (wasn't two men before); the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. Two women shall be grinding (grain) together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
