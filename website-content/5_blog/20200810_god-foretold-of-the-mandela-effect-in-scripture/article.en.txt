I believe the prophecies that I will share led the additional credence to the claims of those of us are trying to warn those around us that this really is happening. This phenomenon is a great mystery to say the least and it is very polarizing because you have people claiming that the bible is changing which does not go over very well for obvious reasons so my goal is to keep the tone and the choice of words loving and civil in hopes that we can all try to keep open minds until enough open debate has taken place.",

She ran back into the prayer meeting to the Christians who were praying for Peter to be supernaturally released and when she let them know they all told her she was crazy. She was reporting a supernatural event and the believers didn't believe her and they called her crazy and this is what is happening with those of us who are suggesting that this in fact is not miss-remembering but that it's happening and so let's just seek to keep the bond of peace before we start using terms like apostate, heretic, and fear mongering charlatan.",

I believe the Mandela Effect is real. It's happening and it's been clearly been prophesied in the bible so that we could know in advance and avoid being deceived. One little house keeping note just for convenience I'm going to refer to those that do not believe this is real as \"the unconvinced\" and those that do as \"truth seekers\" not that the unconvinced aren't truth seekers. Just a handle for convenience sake…nothing derogatory meant by either title ok? So in just a moment I'm going to go through a number of scriptures so that you can at least consider the idea that God may have in fact allowed this to happen. These scriptures will of course be in direct contradiction to the passages that seem to indicate that God would never allow His word to be changed. I believe these promises have been true as well but what I believe I will show is that these promises to preserve the Word of God were only given until the end of the Church Age at which time they were to be taken away to fulfill God's sovereign will and divine wisdom.",

Did God indicate in His word that He would allow the enemy to change the Word of God using some sort of black magic technology given to them by the fallen angels whatever the technique is we don't know and so in this passage you have the following verse in Revelations 22:10.",

It means to not protect from satan the saying of the prophecy. OK? Seal means a mark for security from satan therefore it literally reads protect from satan NOT the sayings of the prophecy.

There are allot of different ways to interpret this but I don't think you could get any more direct wording to describe God giving commandment that would allow satan to fiddle with the bible.",

Verses 1-5 is a vision of paradise but in verse 6 he changes to a warning of what is to come. Where we read show unto his servants the things that shortly must be done. Now in verse 7 we're told that whoever keeps the sayings of the prophecy will be blessed. Now in light of the Mandela Effect I believe there may be a dual meaning in this passage meaning one obviously his obedience but meaning two may mean memorization. Blessed is he who keeps or retains the sayings because the sayings that were once there are going to become twisted fables and unrecognizable distortions of the original and those that have hidden the word in their heart will be sought out.",

In other words let him stay that way. God will remove this beacon of light and direction to Him in the last days. Those of us that are believers will have to know our God very much like Jesus said.

It's a matter of…can this verse be applied to the entire bible and not just Revelations and other ways of taking it in another direction. The commentaries obviously had other things to say than what I'm saying but you can't possibly had interpreted that scripture without having first seen or experienced the Mandela Effect and going back to scriptures to try to find the indications of it in prophecy which is, I believe, it actually means when it says these things are shut up until the end. They are shut up (I speculate this may have been altered words) because you couldn't possibly understand this passage what it would be saying until the event happened and you basically are reverse engineering it at that point.",

Daniel 2:21 the word translated season is the word zamon (sp.) however in Daniel 7 a different word is used. Strong's 1882 which says laws 11 times and decrees 3 times. So in the Hebrew the word actually means the law of God…so guess what. We have yet another end times prophecy that is clearly saying in no uncertain terms there is no ambiguity here whatsoever…God is telling you well in advance that in fact the enemy would seek to change God's word the bible.
