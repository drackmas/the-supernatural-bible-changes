It would not be a famine of food or water in this person's opinion but I would tend to agree with it, but one of his word it states that people will travel from one end of the earth and not find it. This also I believe could be the start of this. God bless you brother for seeing this and speaking about it.

God always knew who they were always and at least through two and maybe three or more Exoduses, I like to jokingly call them Exodi, by land and by sea out of Egypt God moved different people, different nations, at different times to move and reunite the Phares and Zara lines of Judah to become the high kings of Ireland and then Scotland and then England but he did it just like he said he would.",

It was overturned to Ireland. Overturned to Scotland. Overturned to England. It sits now under the coronation char in Westminster Abbey.

Now God is not some cosmic killjoy looking to find you having a good time so that he can put an end to it. That's a viewpoint of too many people in the world and too much of traditional Christianity.
