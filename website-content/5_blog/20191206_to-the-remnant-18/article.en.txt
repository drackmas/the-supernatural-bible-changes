Where we may see anger, rage, sin. He sees a man at the end of his life, knocking in the only way he knows how. We cannot know the heart of man, unless the Lord reveals it to us. Even so we just see glimpses, its true beauty and shape still unknown as our eyes cannot perceive or comprehend the full depth of anthers heart.<br>For He alone know us as we are known. For He has both loved and known us from the beginning in His Love you will find no end.",

Devising schemes and wickedness, that sow lies and strife, the author of all confusion. Seducing spirits and a great delusion.<br>Let us not sleep as the world sleeps, let us be sober and vigilante. Where there is hate let us sow love, where there is malice let us sow mercy. Where there is strife there is every evil work. So let us be peace keepers, wise as serpents harmless as doves, walking by the spirit in His love. Calling our thoughts captive to His Name, letting no darkness reign.",
