Then that unique timeline carrying objects, events and minds divided into sub-timelines which carry in them original data from the original timeline but those are not necessarily all in one timeline all together. For instance our original body, original mind and memories about the world we live and remember are still out there but in combination of 2 or less. Our spirit/soul as cannot be divided ended at one of the freshly created timelines. SO no matter in the sub-timeline where our spirit landed if we are able to see the alterations then our unique spirit is for real there. Not present in the other timelines. If I'm not wrong the tear in time must auto-heal, like when we have a wound. Thus the reason why at least in this timeline it looks we are entering the end of the world, like everything is either disintegrating (the dead tissue/discharge that naturally happen on a wound healing process) and we also see the skin of our timeline somehow having New skin or growing back. (the weird powers we are acquiring) So what would happen is that such tear in time will become one timeline again at some point, so we are living its purging and healing process. When this end, the timeline will become one back again, body mind and spirit all placed together and one line of events only. But by then as we would be in a new timeline, because although the wound belongs to some unique part of the body, the skin will be new.\"",

But what if is all part of a natural process? That we are not confronting the tribulation, or the end times, but we are just seeing the effects of people being soulless because their spirits are placed on different timelines, and then it will cause chaos, blindness, and distention, just by default. Maybe the source of it was supernatural, but maybe we over-demonized the topic. That could be the reason that if you follow prophecy before, events don't match as written, they have severe flaws, like the one saying the mark of the beast will be a mandatory vaccine, but wait a minute according to prophecy the beast have to be revealed first and ruling for a while before the mark is offered, and is never mandatory. It is a choice. SO when you try to explain it as a matching prophecy it only create one or more new rabbit holes.

I'm not a fan of giving too much credit of it to the Devil or a man-made event, even naturally occurring could be my second guess, after God doing the tear.

Instead we started to create and follow several rabbit holes of this and that, fueled by our previous researches and findings on those evildoers which have a nasty track before the original timeline split. Then we chose who to blame: CERN, the Devil, NASA, Mainstream, the Swamp. AS they indeed have such evil track before the timeline splits those were already obvious candidates for the blame.
