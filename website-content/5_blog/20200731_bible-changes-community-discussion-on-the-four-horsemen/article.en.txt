In both instances people of faith were/are looking for literal figure imagined from the susceptible to the same folly and is overlooking the real possibility that he (the anti-christ) has already been revealed.\"",

So because of that imaginary expectation, they missed the fact that Jesus was the Messiah. So Israel was soon destroyed after they crucified Jesus. In the same way but inversely, Christians today expect some single figure of power, and evil and supernatural ability who will lead the world and deceive the world. Many are looking here and there and everywhere, and yet do not recognize that he is already here…he is changing the times and laws just like the prophecies said. He has changed the Bible into an abomination that makes desolate just as the prophecies said. He is against Jesus and is many…Just like the prophecies said, yet because we are expecting this literal evil king, a single figure that would fulfill our darkest imaginations, we are missing the real evidence both in the world and in the scriptures right before our eyes.\"",

However, the circumstances surrounding the 'expectations' and all you describe ARE the same way. There is a distinction. Basically remove those phrases and you have a more 'solid' position in my observation. Just thought I would throw that out there for your consideration.\"",
