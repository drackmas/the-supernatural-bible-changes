Desc: A closer look at the division that is taking place between those that see the supernatural changes taking place and those that don't. Why have our relationships with the people around us grown cold? What changed them? Who changed them? Where do we go from here? It's the wheat and the tares growing until the final harvest when Jesus returns.

Why? It all has to do with one of the covenants God made in the bible and if you are God's then that call is not going to go away because God promised and therefore has an obligation to bring you to Him or bring you back to Him and the harder you fight Him as I'm sure many of you have found right now…the more extreme His workings in your life is going to have to be in order for Him to be able to fulfill what He promised.",
